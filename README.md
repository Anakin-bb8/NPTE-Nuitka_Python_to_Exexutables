# ATTENTION!
On Windows 10, the setup file and the app are flagged as malitious software. In the file there aren't any viruses (is a false positive, in Windows 11 they aren't flagged), so, on Windows 10, I reccommend to download the zip file `Windows 10 app`, who contains the `.py` file and the assets folder. To make the software work properly, the Python file and the assets folder have to be placed in the same directory.

# Description
This software is completely developed in Python language and converted in `.exe` with the nuitka Python library.
The app is made to simplify the creation of Windows executables.

# How to use
To utilize the app, you have to insert your program infos (Name, Author...), then click on the "Start Build" button. The software will create a `Build.bat` file, that you have to execute to convert your Python script into a fully working Windows application!

# Installation
To install the software, you have to chose the release wich you prefer from the releases section, then download the `NPTESetup{version}.exe` and execute him. You can also download the zip file with the Python file and the assets folder.
